                <p>Hrlbd does not own any travel products.

                <h4>Booking Terms</h4>
                <p>If you make a booking through Our Website for Travel Products, that booking is made with the Travel Provider named on the booking page and Our Website only acts as a user interface. Accordingly, Hrlbd has no responsibility for the booking or the Travel Product because Hrlbd has no involvement in creating the description of the Travel Product, in defining the price and any fees, or in providing the Travel Products that you book. If you have any issues or disputes with your booking and/or the Travel Product, you agree to address and resolve these with the Travel Provider and not with us.</p><br>
